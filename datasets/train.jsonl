While almost any American artist can sing in a language other than English phonetically, Ronstadt captures the pronunciations, accent, dialect, intonations flawlessly and naturally ! She rolls with the r's and rolls with the rhythm.Aside from her wonderful Spanish, this album never misses a beat and is not filled with any kind of questionable material. It is a Latin\/jazz and nostalgic tour deforce by one of America's famous adult contemporary artists...\n\n## emotion:\npositive\n"}

I've got a foot in both camps--some of it is just too, too much--other things I want to make immediately. My main problem is the lack of charts. He states that one cushion can be easily coverted to a chair seat--true, if there were a chart to begin with. Now, I can understand that a wing back chair might be a one off, but there is no excuse for showing a tantalizing close up of a pillow without a chart! It is too frustrating. And there are far too many references to things that are available as kits from Ehrman--particularly when not all of them are still available. Still worth it for the charts that he does include and for some design ideas--if you are willing to just pile on the patterns!\n\n## emotion:\npositive\n"}

Brendan Buchanan has so many different aliases it was difficult to decide who he was at any one time in the story. Ed Asner does the reading, and I wasn't thrilled with his voice, it sounded very throaty and clogged. Our protagonist's aliases are discovered at a cafe in Cancun Mexico, and at that point he remains in mortal danger for the rest of the story, never sure who to trust, even the members of the operations unit he works for. Despite lots of action and plot twists, what I think the story really was about goes deeper: Brendan Buchanan must unmask his own layers upon layers of aliases to discover who he really is, and in doing so, he falls in love, and must admit to himself he is, after all, just one person.\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}

The characters have very little depth. Trains are used for traveling between planets instead of spaceships, with no explanation. The trains must always travel along specific paths, except when they don't. These trains carry functional spacecraft, but they are only used as weak attack craft. Main character wants to be a soldier\/cop, but insists on using a non-functional gun. There are trains that render you dead if you accidentally get on them. The trains can be destroyed with very little effort, and frequently are, but people still want to ride them. All the problems are apparently caused by one particular alien in a vast galaxy wide invasion force.

I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. \n\nI am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. \n\nI spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.\n\nI have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. \n\nRenting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.\n\nI feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. \n\nI applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. \n\nI spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. \n\nTwo years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. \n\nSpent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.\n\nI got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..\n\nI just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. \n\nI also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. \n\nI have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

I'm have traveled abroad three different times...yet when others tell me about their travels I feel inadequate. My dreams and goals feel absolutely impossible. When ever I go out into public I think everyone hates me and is talking about me. I also constantly google mental illness and symptoms because I am convinced something is majorly wrong with me...even though three doctors have told me I am \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?

Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy\/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.\n\nI am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI\/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.\n\n## emotion:\nMedication\n"}

I'm the only caretaker for my mom and it's exhausting. I've given up having a childhood a long time ago and all my major moments in life from periods to dating has been done on my own. I have a lot of siblings but all are married and were gone before I reached high school. My dad was always in a sense abusive, mostly if I did something wrong in his eyes I was yelled at, slapped, etc. even now. Just yesterday he got frustrated because he got a phone call about work and in his frustration he grabbed the nearest thing and threw it at me. Which caused my hand to be bloody. I have a boyfriend, well had, who's the absolute sweetest and the other day I broke up with him. I wanted him to not be hurt when I make the choice to go. He was the only goodbye I needed to make. I'm just so tired. So worn out. I want to stop being a burden and a drag down. If I'm gone my dad can finally know I'm not a disappointment because then I wont be alive to be one. Then this morning a video popped up, it was talking about there's still a chance to get past this. If I go through it'll be my 5th and last attempt. I think my boyfriend (ex) has figured out I'm going to do it. He keeps begging me not to. I want to do this to stop hurting people, I want to stop feeling hurt. I can't seek help because in my culture from church and everything that means that you'd be completely turned away by the whole community. I'm just unsure of where to go. I want to stop being a drain on people. I want to stop feeling drained.\n\n## emotion:\nRelationships\n"}

She suffers from depression, anxiety and severe OCD.\n\nOver the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it's just too much for me, we don't see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i've ended up having to cancel plans. It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go. Fair enough, but I have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself.\n\nShe's not from here so has no family or friends here who aren't mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but I'm exhausted. I can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she doesn't want me to tell anyone. She believes she is just in the way and makes everyone's life shit, I try and tell her it's not true but it's so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she'd be better off dead, she's threatened suicide before so I feel like if I leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it's not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she's better off dead. Idk anymore, I really don't. I don't even know if this is just kme being an asshole i'm just lost and confused and tired. I still love her but she just doesn't care about life anymore.\n\nShe stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, I respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it's absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication. IDK please help, should I leave? I'm so worried about her but also worried about myself and just feel sick.\n\n## emotion:\nRelationships\n"}

He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time. \nI used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. \n\nI'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can't deal with this anymore.\n\nI moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice. The only time I used to use my voice was while playing video-games online, it was the only thing that brought me a bit of joy. But my console broke, and I can't afford to fix it.\n\nI have no ambitions. I don't know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I'm a loser that is eating his life away. The only future I envision having is honestly the one where I throw myself off of my apartment building. I think about just ending it all the time. \n\nI feel alone in this world, and I don't have the motivation nor the self-confidence to do anything about it. The only people that may care about me are the couple family members I have, but I have put them under so much shit for all of the stuff I've done in the past that they are fed up with me. I want to kill myself, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.\n\n## emotion:\nRelationships\n"}

I feel like I am two people right now. One version is ready to go and has a solid plan for how to do it. The other version is horrified and sick at this.

But I'm failing at life, really want to die, and am too embarrassed to explain to the people closest to me that I would rather die than proceed with my futile attempts at life. So here I am, on reddit, for some unknown fucking reason. I guess I just need to vent and this seems like the best place because I'm sure no one I know will look here. So here it goes\n\nI'm 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don't deserve. Most of my life I've been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I'm too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. \n\nFrom elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nice guy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I'm pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don't mean much. Just the time that I wasn't absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I'm with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C's all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. \n\nAfter high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde's. Pretty much every semester after that I've failed classes. Not because I'm not learning the material but because I'm so fucking lazy I don't do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don't understand why they give me so many chances. \n\nAnyways, this year isn't any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I've ever done. So this current semester I'm retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don't get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili's, I live at home, have everything going for me; don't have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can't fucking pass two fucking classes.\n\nI'm a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can't pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn't be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I've planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I've scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven't written my goodbye letter because I'm honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won't even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...\n\nI know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I'm almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don't think he'll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.\nOnly one I'm worried about is my girlfriend. She's about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don't want to ruin that. I'm sure I can figure something out.\n\nAt the same time. I really don't want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that's about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...\n\nGuess I'll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.\n\nAnyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I've done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n## emotion:\nJobs and careers\n"}

Does anyone else relate to this?? Just feeling sad bc there's so many horrible things in this world?\n\n## emotion:\nAlienation\n"}

My closest friend had a heart to heart with me about it and even though it still hurts losing the only place I felt I could relax and enjoy myself I was starting to let it go now that I knew I didn't have to worry about coming back. Still have some hangups about it all but again it was all getting better. \n\n\nThen I dont here from my Girlfriend for 3 days, finally getting a message from her the day after my birthday with her saying she's dealing with stuff and that none of its my fault and that I didnt do anything. She wont talk to me about it whatever it is and I know its bad cause she isn't acting like herself. Part of me is afraid it has to do with me but isn't my fault. I talked with a close friend and I was able to regain some of my reasoning to eventually tell her that until she wants to talk with me I'll leave her be and give her space to think. But it's still a bit disheartening that she doesn't say I love you back...its been 2 insistence and the second time she just said \"You Too\" so maybe she's just distracted by her thoughts and forgot. \n\n\nThis year has been the saddest year of all for me, I wont say depressing cause I haven't been diagnosed, and I'm just hoping these feelings go away cause I'm not myself and that annoys me to no end. I'm the guy who helps others, talks them through their issues, makes people laugh, makes others happy. I'm not the sad, whimpering, insecure, paranoid guy I'm acting like... \n\n\nBut thats all I guess I have to say...thank you all for listening.\n\n## emotion:\nAlienation\n"}

I thought I worked through it. I thought I was better. But I'm 22 now and for about the last year, things have been gradually getting worse. I'm at the point now where I guess I'm probably passively suicidal? I have suicidal thoughts but I have no intention on acting on it. The urges to self harm have also occasionally come back, but I haven't done anything.\n\nI'm frustrated because nothing specifically happened to bring me back here. It just happened. I'm really struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It feels like I put all that work in for nothing, I'm almost right back where I was and why keep putting so much effort into something that's futile and I'm always just gunna end up here again.\n\nI'm not quite at my lowest low, but I'm afraid if something doesn't change I'll get there. I guess for as long as I'm scared of being suicidal that's hope.\n\nIdk, I feel lonely and the few people close to me wouldn't understand. I know that sounds cliche but truly none of them have had depression, and when I've tried approaching it they say something cliche and unhelpful like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153things will get better I promise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?Or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153try taking a walk, the sun and movement always helps me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?Like yeah wow thanks I never thought to do that before lol.

I've sat on my ass and done practically nothing for the past 2 years, got withdrawn at 15 from school due to mom worried that I'd get bullied for being trans, tried homeschooling but fell out of it. I always said that I'm not a true drop-out because I plan on getting into college at some point, but right now I don't even know if that's possible. \n\nMy body is worthless, 6 feet tall and 130 lbs, nobody wants to date a skeleton, and if they do, maybe there is something wrong with them... I can get skinny people, but ones who are bony to the point of concern... I can't get why anyone would be attracted to me. Yet I somehow have a boyfriend. \n\nMy jawline and brow ridge make me look like a fucking Neanderthal, and yet I've been told that I'd pass fine with estrogen, they're all just being nice. They know the crushing, suicidal feeling it is if you're ever told that you can't pass, and they simply don't want me to get pushed over the edge and end it, they're only being nice. \n\nHaven't gotten a job, haven't even gotten a license, and haven't done anything school related much either. I just sit on my ass and play video games, watch youtube, anime, listen to music, I just do my hobbies, I think about getting off my ass and getting my life back on track but the lack of motivation I have is weighing me down like an anvil tied to my ankles. I just feel no need to...\n\nI'm a joke, and one with a mediocre punchline too. Somebody respectable would have done SOMETHING by now, I've been emotionally biasd by my stepfather for a few years but I got over it, so I really can't use that reason or excuse. I could have had a job, had a license and be in college right now, but I can't. Because I lack any motivation, because I don't want my license to say \"male\" or my dead name, because I don't want to be discriminated or humiliated at any public workplaces for being trans, maybe if I wasn't such a lazy pussy, I could have gotten somewhere. \n\nBut nah, I haven't, and it's all because of laziness, lack of motivation, and fear. 6 months to recover? Fair enough, a year? Maybe if it's that serious, but 2 years? Sigh... If there is one word anyone can describe me as, it would be; a failure.\n\nI'm sorry that I let everyone down, and I'm sorry that I've disappointed you...\n\n## emotion:\nBias or abuse\n"}

I feel bad because it probably seems like I am searching for some kind of attention, but I'm not I'm just so depressed and done with everything that I have no where else to turn. I used to text those crisis hotlines, but they never help anymore. They're all trained to recite the same things, and it's aggravating having the same conversation over and over again where it doesn't really feel like my feelings are really being validated. \n\nEveryone goes through things. I know that as much as the next person. The world is a cruel yet charming place filled with a mixture of amazing people and people who couldn't give two shits about others. I hate how complicated the world is, and I hate how the good things people do never seems to lessen the bad things. I have turned into such a cynical person and as time goes on I've found it harder and harder to see good in the world past some amazing friends and the unconditional love that animals provide. After someone killed my beloved dog though, everything just feels bleak again. He didn't deserve the death he got, and it angers me that nobody even wants to put in the time to find out who would have done this to my best friend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It won't bring him back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? you're right. It won't, but maybe it would settle this raging anger I have inside? Maybe it would help me feel less guilty about the fact I wasn't there for him because I was too busy fucking around in college? He gave me everything, and I gave him loneliness while someone brutally murdered him. \n\nI can never understand why I feel this way, and why everything in my life is going to shit. I'm so very tired and done with the world. When my mom died March 2019, I thought that was what finally broke me, but then I started to get better. I went to counseling, I leaned on my friends, and I started to cope better. I honestly thought that everything was finally looking up, but the world likes to put people like me back in their place. The more I think about it, the more I consider the fact that I'm probably meant for misery and this is why the world constantly kicks me back down when I start to get back on my feet. Coming home for spring break was a mistake as well. My father has done nothing but make me feel worse inside, and I have done nothing but be a recluse in my room watching Netflix. I have started to draw away from my support system too, not because they've done anything wrong but because I am tired of bothering them and they all have their own things going on in life without me coming around to be the depressed sack of shit that I am. \n\nI wish I hadn't failed my suicide attempts in the past. I wish I was selfish, naive, and brave enough to try again. I wish I didn't feel these things inside. Everyone would probably be better off without me anyway. My mom would be alive, my sweet baby would be alive, because I guarantee it was karma towards me that took them away. Karma for being a shit person.\n\n## emotion:\nBias or abuse\n"}

If you are a Mike Judge fan, or enjoy shows like Futurama, then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipping over this little known, limited release. Although the DVD touts very few \"bonus features\", this film is certainly funny enough to make up for it's perceived \"lack of value\".<br \/><br \/>This movie is about an army grunt by the name of Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) who is part of a top secret Army experiment designed to preserve Army personnel in peace time so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our country. However, things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten. Bowers, and his sidekick Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both find themselves awake in the year 2505, where through the course of natural selection, the population of America has grown increasingly stupid. Now Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard).<br \/><br \/>What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comedic satire on the course of US History over the last 50 years, and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years. This is most evidenced by the advertising in the movie, which has become a staple of the American culture. With shows like South Park in the mainstream media, it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future, profanity has become a marketing tool. This is portrayed in the film humorously with subtle things such as \"Fudd-Ruckers\" changing their name to \"Butt-F###ers\", and a billboard which displays the advertisement \"If you don't smoke Tarryltons... F### You!\". I also cannot stop laughing at Carls Jr.'s role in this future, with their slogan \"F### you... I'm eating\", and their automated kiosks self-advertising their \"Extra Big-A## Tacos\". (with more molecules)! This film contained everything I go to the movies for. Excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as an engrossing plot make this DVD one for the ages. Be warned, however. If you are not a fan of Mike Judge, did not care for \"Beavis and Butthead\", or do not have a sense of humor, then this movie probably isn't a good match for you. Otherwise, I would say this is probably the funniest movie to come out of 2506... I mean 2006.\n\n## emotion:\npositive\n"}

The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision\/idea\/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there? This is not to say that there is no vision here, just that I was hard put to discover it. Be that as it may, there are still things to enjoy. The punk flavour is refreshing and funny. Toyah Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I did not much care about Williams as Prospero ... not enough magic I suppose. The switches between the old monastery\/castle and the (very English) world outside can be a little unsettling at times, but I guess that is intentional.

The fusion is highly entertaining.<br \/><br \/>Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br \/><br \/>My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a \"spy thriller\". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.<br \/><br \/>Moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is coming into his own. The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before.\n\n## emotion:\npositive\n"}

Cut to present day Bucharest where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a rich American ambassador from his kidnappers. In pursuit of one of the kidnappers Griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood & no visible signs of what happened to him. Meanwhile Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) & her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are renovating a church when the church labourer Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) informs Richard that he has found some ancient relic, the two investigate & find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons & one very angry & very much alive Gargoyle who wastes no time in killing them both. Griffin & Wells are on the case when they are reported missing & soon realise that local legends of monstrous Gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) planning to flood the world with them...<br \/><br \/>Co-written, co-produced & directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is yet another masterpiece Wynorski can add to his credits, not. The script by Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence & Bill Munroe is crap, is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. For a start I would like to know if there was only one Gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because I'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. How did it survive in that hole for 500 years? What did it eat? How did the priest know it was there? Why has no one else ever figured it out? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To rule it? The Gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world & then let some priest just rule it like a king & if they did what would be left to rule? Much like the guys who wrote Gargoyle I don't think he thought it through that well did he? Whichever way I look at it, whichever way I approach it, from whichever angle I try to figure it out from, no matter how many times I try to square the circle Gargoyles just doesn't make any sense & they story has huge plot holes, lapses in logic & isn't that great to start with anyway. The character's are dull & clich\u00e9d, the action repetitive & unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through. People do illogical things & everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince Griffin that Gargoyle's exist & one just suddenly shows up & attacks them. The cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of Aliens (1986) it's embarrassing & the ending was lame. The bit on the large Ferris Wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights & forced him to get on it.<br \/><br \/>Director Wynorski cuts costs & steals footage from other films, in fact the best scene from Gargoyle is a car chase through Bucharest but it was taken from the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film Maximum Risk (1996). There are no shocks, scares or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game & has little interaction with any living cast members, there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky & trying to appear scarred. There isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable, there is one awful decapitation & that's it.<br \/><br \/>Technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable, the Romanian locations look suitably Romanian. Gargoyle went straight-to-video & it shows with a pretty cheap look & feel to it. The acting isn't up to much, personality bypass victim Michael Pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes.<br \/><br \/>Gargoyle is a crap film, it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. A total waste of 90 minutes as far as I'm concerned, one to avoid.\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}

You need to identify this comment positive or negative.\n\n## input:\nA woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br \/><br \/>The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br \/><br \/>As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br \/><br \/>And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br \/><br \/>If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0\/10<br \/><br \/>P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}

{"name":"imdb-classification","prompt":"In this task, you will get a movie comment. You need to identify this comment positive or negative.\n\n## input:\nDespite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone.<br \/><br \/>The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins.<br \/><br \/>In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu.<br \/><br \/>But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the \"actress\" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this clich\u00e9 movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.<br \/><br \/>Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet. <br \/><br \/>The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which are, by the way, not really convincing.<br \/><br \/>Bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and story.\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}
{"name":"imdb-classification","prompt":"In this task, you will get a movie comment. You need to identify this comment positive or negative.\n\n## input:\nAh, the spirit of '68. The streets of Paris were running wild with rebellion, the hippies were high on the spirit of love. How was Britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution? Erm, by the looks of it, dear Old Blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools. If... contains the evil establishment. It contains the uprising of the oppressed. What it lacks in contrast to the Parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement, except in its all-out ammo-and-artillery fire ending.<br \/><br \/>Lindsay Anderson's If... stars the ever-marvellous Malcolm McDowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of Lenin and other left-wing radicals. It's clearly an anti-establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper-class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish-posh public school standard. What makes If... unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies, it doesn't explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system, instead it just kind of floats: lacking in plot and lacking in personality.<br \/><br \/>Surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black-and-white to colour again (is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression?), but there is little of interest to speak of. All we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment. Hooray! A revolution! At last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming.<br \/><br \/>If... could have been a powerful political statement, but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end. Instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late-Sixties, it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper-class British education. Anarchy? Apathy more like, the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching If... will be Lindsay Anderson.\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}
{"name":"imdb-classification","prompt":"In this task, you will get a movie comment. You need to identify this comment positive or negative.\n\n## input:\nI've read all the Dave Robicheaux novels and consider James Lee Burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I've also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say, I greatly anticipated seeing \"In the Electric Mist,\" especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be terrific as Robicheaux.<br \/><br \/>I was greatly disappointed. The story was very choppy; the interplay with the \"ghosts of Confederate dead\" was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was doleful, expressionless and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my \"ditto\" to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old made-for-TV movies. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time.<br \/><br \/>The location settings were accurate, and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous, smoky juke joints and eerie above-ground graveyards of South Louisiana. Too bad the story's disjointed presentation and Tommy Lee's sub-par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region.<br \/><br \/>Next to final comment: In the novels, Dave Robicheaux's nickname is \"Streak,\" because of the distinct streak of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (Similar to how the Sopranos' Paulie Walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile.) Tommy Lee had no such streak in this film, probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing Mr. Jones's poor imitation of Dave Robicheaux.<br \/><br \/>Final comment: While I generally find Alec Baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in \"Heaven's Prisoners\" than Tommy Lee was in \"In the Electric Mist.\" Also, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie.<br \/><br \/>\"In the Electric Mist\" is okay to watch when one feels like \"veging out\" and there's nothing better on TV. But then, so are infomercials.\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}

Something about Daphne, about the creepy call-girl, about the whole damn (and I use the word literally) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress. This film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel unclean.<br \/><br \/>One of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the clich\u00e9 Worst Nightmare and the overdone Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating film idea.<br \/><br \/>Thought: The reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights. During the day, bright lights don't show up well, so they could go anywhere.<br \/><br \/>Count the Hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio, and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie.<br \/><br \/>Discussion Question: If you had a frigid, demanding, unappreciative girlfriend, would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead?

{"name":"imdb-classification","prompt":"In this task, you will get a movie comment. You need to identify this comment positive or negative.\n\n## input:\nAs a teenager, I was pretty into the whole Bigfoot thing - I read the books and followed the reported sightings. As a more jaded adult, I've largely given up on the big guy now, but don't mind watching the odd movie when I come across one. This one had a few strong points to it - mainly, the recreations of two of the more famous Bigfoot encounters - the Ape Canyon incident of 1924 and the Bauman incident of c.1850 as related to and by Teddy Roosevelt, both of which I'm somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading I did. The movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch, whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations, but the recreations were well done. There's also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous Patterson video, again taking for granted its authenticity. The sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men. Unfortunately, in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes, whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half.<br \/><br \/>It's the fictional story (done in a documentary style) of an expedition to a remote area of northern British Columbia, to the suspected home range of the sasquatch. A computer had targeted this area based on sightings and - in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie - the computer also used \"eyewitness sightings\" to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the \"creature\" of the Patterson video! Aside from those 20 minutes I mentioned, we basically watch this expedition travel, which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip. I've been on camping trips with the guys. Let me tell you - they've never been worthy of a movie. Interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice wildlife shots (although one suspects that canned footage was used, or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals) and there are some spectacular scenery shots, except that the scenery isn't of northern British Columbia, it's from national parks in Oregon.<br \/><br \/>I did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch, so we didn't have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this. 3\/10\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}

You need to identify this comment positive or negative.\n\n## input:\nEddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy. Great expectationa often lead to dissapointment, and this proves to be the case.<br \/><br \/>When Eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by Detective Robert, they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality TV cop show. Logic is not a great component of this movie. The super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it. A twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is as more a fantasy than science fiction. A five pound gun, firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past.<br \/><br \/>It is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children, so if you are somewhere in between, this is the movie for you.\n\n## emotion:\nnegative\n"}

Take as many friends as you can, to have a table in the main hall you will want about 10 people in your group. The beer is great and people really get going with the live band and start dancing on the tables and such. Plus the servers and Jagermeister girl will come around and try to spank you. The music is awesome and everyone pretty much sings along, if your looking for a quiet evening they have the beer garden in the back which is not nearly as intense but is still really cool. Basically imagine a party version of the beer fest movie. The food is the best German in Vegas but the main attraction is the beer and atmosphere. They have free valet and a taxi stand so transport is no prob. The bill can really sneak up on you so make sure your ready for a few hundred buck s total with a large group and everyone drinking.

{"name":"yelp_review_full-classification","prompt":"Select the most appropriate emotion from Disappointed, Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, or Delighted to describe the movie review that you will receive.\n\n## input:\nWe absolutely loved this place. We were in town for only two nights for dinner, and ate here the first night because we were staying at the Bellagio. We seriously considered eating there a second night. Our waiter was a British fella named Lawrence from Alabama (yeah that was interesting) but he was extremely entertaining. He is by far the best waiter we've had at any restaurant. \\n\\nThe food was so fresh and flavorful. We appreciated that they source local and sustainable foods and grow their own herbs and some veggies. We had the crispy fried shrimp and the crab-lobster maki roll for appetizers. Both were excellent with outstanding flavorful sauces. My wife had the curry scallops which were incredible and not a normal way to have scallops but might be the best when it comes to flavor fusion. The scallops were perfectly prepared. I had the fresh catch of the day which was line caught tuna, on spaghetti squash. It was super yummy and fresh. It was actually more than I could eat. No small plates here. There were baby purple potatoes on my plate too which tasted like they were dug that morning; I know because I grow my own food. For dessert we had two dessert wines. Two white wines with the dinner brought the tab to $200 not including tip. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was very sensual as the name suggests. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant with glass panes so you can see everything. Lawrence would explain to us what they were doing in the kitchen. We were placed with a perfect view of everything. \\n\\nThe night we went (a Tuesday night) was quiet and slow. It shouldn't have been as slow as it was; this might be the best kept secret in Vegas. We've eaten at many more expensive and higher rated restaurants in Vegas; Sensi has just moved to the top of our list. We are going there first for our next trip\n\n## emotion:\nDelighted\n"}

Beers were pricey, but the wine and cocktail prices seemed about average. Now the food. THE FOOD. We started with the crispy calamari, which was thick and perfectly cooked! It came with a gingery Thai inspired sauce which was flavorful but not heavy at all. For entrees, I got the truffle burger and my bf got the Capone burger. Both were very unique and extremely satisfying!!! We also split the waffle fries that were topped with cheese sauce, crab meat, and truffle oil. I'm sure we shaved 5 yrs off our lives, but it was worth it AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.\n\n## emotion:\nDelighted\n"}

And waited some more. Oh someone's on vacation, someone hasn't cleared the unit to be rented, we're totally booked, insert excuse of the day here. \\n\\nWe ended up getting a town house not far away and we won't be getting even a partial refund even though they were the ones doing the foot dragging and couldn't get it done. \\n\\nOh and they ran a background check and just like last time it came back that someone with my name had a felony stealing charge. Turns out it was for someone with my middle and last names that generated the hit. Excluding my legendary lead foot I have no other items on my record so having the staff obtain a messed up report and look at you suspiciously because their background service is clueless is not something anyone should have to put up with. \\n\\nRating: Drop to 1 Star, with placement on the appropriate lists and yes, even a braying jackass could have handled this one better.

The people working there seemed annoyed that I was even there, especially when I mentioned that it should still be under warranty.  One gentleman took a quick look at it, showed me a couple of points of maintenance I should consider for it's upkeep, offered some thinly veiled belittlement for not knowing how to properly maintain a lawn mower, and said it would be over a week before they could have it ready.  I don't know much about lawnmowers or how to repair them, but this shouldn't be a hard fix for them, certainly nothing that should take over a week.  The whole experience was completely awkward.

Well this time it wasna horrible experience when my wife and I arrived it was jammed packed there was a 45 min wait.  So we were offered to sit in the lounge to have a drink and wait for a table. Well we walked in and it was dark and it looked like a sex den out of the 70's tables were dirty and there were questionable stains on the cloth lounges I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. So a waitress cleaned off our table and asked what we wanted to drink so my wife ordereda drink for us to share because it was a large drink and I hadnt ate yet. But the kicker was that the Peppermill has a no hat policy in their lounge? Strange I had a hat on it was a tastful hat nothing gang related or any of that cliche stuff, I was asked to remove my hat because they had problems in the past with people wearing hats strange? I refuse to remove my hat because not only I didnt see a sign stating it but i saw few indivduals in the same area wearing hats so I asked for management, management arrived and she stated that it was just there policy she could gove me a solid reason for the policy she proceeded to tell me about their lawyers came up with this policy odd? So I asked her if I had an open wound or religous wrap hat on my head I would be refused services or would be asked to leave there lounge at this point I was bother by the BS policy the manager offered to see if she could bump up our table wait so im able eat in their dining room with my hat but cant drink in their lounge what BS. I was uncomfortable about the whole thing and I left. This nearly cost my vacation to be ruined cause my wife wanted to eat there still at the Peppermill and i refused too because their double standard unexplainable rule.\n\n## emotion:\nDisappointed\n"}

I take back my previous statement that the owner is friendly. Biaggio contacted me after my review and asked for a chance to prove himself. Okay, I thought, why not give him another chance. So I called and placed the same order I did the first time and told him who I was. When I arrived to pick up my order, he asked that I not post on Yelp what he was doing to fix my previous visit should I happen to change my review. I said that I would not. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't open his business to be a 2- or 3-star business and that \\\"wasn't the service\\\" I got there. To me, that basically means he is calling me a liar, and I told him so. He denied this. I told him that I used to work at a pizza place and that isn't how you do business. He said that he had nothing to offer me besides the garlic knots. I told him that I ordered enough food that night for my family to eat dinner and that  we ended up hungry because he was busy and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said, \\\"We're out.\\\" He again said that it didn't happen, and that's when I got even more mad. I told him I would never be back again. \\n\\nYou don't ask for a second chance to prove yourself to a customer and then when he comes in call him a liar and hint that you would like him to change his review and add more stars. That's not how you do business, especially if you think you are providing 5-star service. Whatever happened to \\\"The customer is always right?\\\" When did it become \\\"The customer is a liar if he says he had bad service?\\\"  All he had to do when I came in was say, \\\"I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I hope this one was better,\\\" and I would have been a returning customer. As it is, I will never go back. Not with an owner that treats customers that way.\n\n## emotion:\nDisappointed\n"}

In fact, I came in having just done a 9 mile walk.  \\n\\nI had a few minutes to take a look at what they have on display before someone offered to help me.  I said I wanted walking shoes, we verified my size, and away he went.  I found this kind of interesting - what about the price?  I couldn't help but notice the fact that most of the running shoes were around the \\u00a3100 mark though ranged down to more affordable prices.  Are the clientele here the type to not look at price tags?  And what about style?  Ok I realise they're exercise shoes, but surely people have a style preference?\\n\\nThe guy came back with a stack of boxes and took out the first pair for me to try.  They were grey with pink detailing.  I cringed that the pink but duitifully tried them on.  I found them hard and uncomfortable and said this to the guy who responded \\\"they're walking shoes, that's how they're supposed to be\\\" - oh, but why?  Why is it that apparently walking shoes are hard while running shoes have bounce to them?  He went on to explain how arch support works.  I know how arch support works and am going to assume that running shoes have arch support, so this doesn't actually explain to me why walking shoes are so hard.  Anyway.\\n\\nBased on my feedback, he presented me with a pair of aqua and orange shoes.  Seriously.  I said they were way too flashy so he went to get a few more pairs.  I was then given the option between silver and purple, and blue and red (or something).  I said they were all far too colorful and was told \\\"Well, that's all we have, sorry\\\" at which point he turned around and immediately started helping someone else.\\n\\nAm I the only person to come in here looking for good shoes that don't blind passers by?  Do they really only have ridiculously coloured walking shoes?  \\n\\nAlso - WHY was one of the guys working here wearing teeny tiny running short shorts??  Ok I get it, you're a runner.  You know what you're talking about.  Do you have fantastic legs?  Absolutely.  Do I want to be just about eye level with your barely covered arse when I'm trying on shoes?  No.  I dont.  \\n\\nFar from my experience, everyone else in here was getting excellent service, getting a chance to properly try out the shoes on treadmills.  From what Alison K has said, this is much more than just a shoe store.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, for whatever reason (I can't help but wonder if my post-walk attire was why) I didn't receive this kind of service and what I experienced won't see me returning.\n\n## emotion:\nDissatisfied\n"}

The waiter went way beyond the typical aloofness of  waitstaff in better restaurants -- he was downright  rude when he saw that our table was two women only -- neither of whom was drinking.  What he doesn't know is we both have backgrounds in the culinary industry and tip, at the very least, 20% for very poor service and up to 50% for outstanding service.  Needless to say he got 20%.  The crudo was outrageously priced and disappointing.  I got the crudo with \\\"the mixed pickled veggies\\\".  The mixed veggies were only scallions -- one of my least favorite foods.  I guess it could be called \\\"veggies\\\" (multiple) because there was more than one scallion.  The waiter was less than helpful when I asked about the source of the beef  because Customshop is known for serving some local and organic foods.

Let's just get that out of the way now. Half of the menu consists of tacos! Wasabi is a common ingredient. The standard side dish is coleslaw, when everyone knows in Hawaii its macaroni salad. Let us all just agree to call this some a pan Polynesian\/Pan Pacific\/Southwestern \/American fusion restaurant. Yeah, I find that confusing too. \\n\\nOur first trip to Hula's was unexpected. We were walking from our friend's home to Maizie's and decided we should just pop into Hula's on the way. If you are taking the LR I would suggest getting off at the Campbell stop, but I think its 6 of one, 1\/2 dozen of the other between that and Camelback. If you are driving they have a huge parking lot. \\n\\nThe initial visit was 4 days after they opened and we had some hits and misses with the food. I really enjoyed the fish ceviche, while my husband did not as he does not usually like fish ceviche. The shrimp rolls were a huge hit. I thought that the hapu was adequate, as was the mahi mahi. Our friend ordered a steak which was one of the grossest, grizzliest steaks I have ever seen. We left that night wanting to try it again, so we made reservations for a group of friends for my husband's birthday the following week. \\n\\nUpon our return we tried the tuna poke which was fantastic and the pulled pork sandwich which was poor, IMO. My kalua pork is a million times better. On the first visit we had tried the sweet potato fries and they were pretty lackluster so we tried the plantains the second time around. The fried plantains were some of the most disgusting things that I have been served at a restaurant in a long time. I was hoping for fried plantains in chip form but they were hunks of plantains. Plantains as a non fried fruit are not really all that great, there is a reason why they are always served cooked in some way. By not splitting them up into smaller pieces the starchy flavor is overpowering. As far as food is concerned I feel that you have to really try different things to find their strengths. \\n\\nAs far as drinks are concerned, get the Absolut Boston with lemonade. Thank me later. I have a PhD in mai tais and I will tell you that these are just average. They are entirely too sweet and the dark rum was not floating on the top, but rather it was shaken with the light rum like you would shake a martini. That is not the proper way to make a mai tai. We ordered a few volcano bowls for my husband's birthday and while they were strong, they were also very sweet. Tropical drinks don't have to be sweet! I really want a Tropical Itch or a Lava Flow but to be honest I'm not sure they offer them. \\n\\nService is hit or miss. On his birthday my husband was wearing a birthday hat and our server actually asked him- in what I believe was complete seriousness- if it was his birthday. What? Really? \\n\\nThe indoor space is great, not such a fan of the lighting on the patio. I think I will probably be back for that adult Arnold Palmer and apps. At the time we were there they didn't have a happy hour, but they have added one now.\n\n## emotion:\nNeutral\n"}

We decided to try it on Sunday after church. It  looked like it might be crowded with all the cars in the parking lot but when we got in the restaurant was bigger than it looks and it didn't feel cramped at all. Another surprise is apparently Sunday's they just do a buffet.  \\n\\nThe inside was your typical American-Chinese restaurant look with the brass bars, and large fish tanks and a bit of flair from the 80's.  One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb is the absence of sound. It honestly felt like family dinner time after report cards came out. Besides the occasional cough and banging of fork on the plate that was it. My wife and I actually felt uncomfortable holding a conversation above a faint whisper. Don't know what the deal was with that maybe the other customers were regulars and were used to the \\\"no talking while you eat\\\".\\n\\nThe food was average. It was a relatively small buffet, featuring two types of rice, some noodles, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, chicken wings, and about 5 variations of chicken, cashews, and sauce.  I will say the egg rolls were the size of hot pockets and tasted like had been either fried way to long or they were using old oil. The sesame chicken was crispy which was nice but the sauce tasted like it was just poured out of a drum. Nothing to write home about.  At least the service was good. I noticed on someone else's review, they mentioned the service is a little over bearing at times. I couldn't take a sip of tea with out him trying to refill it.  All in all it was a very bland an QUIET lunch.

We tried to have a healthy breakfast for her at the restaurant next door to the spa, but they refused us access.

The only restaurant they suggest is their spotted donkey restaurant which is off campus so to speak. I find it very ironic that the cafe next to the spa is full of sweaty, smelly people and a well dressed, polite three year is denied access.

If you pay .50 for a to go box and make a huge meal then it's worth the money since you get 2 meals out of it then. However, most times I go there for lunch during work and I don't have a way to save leftovers so I pay a little more than I would like for just a weekday lunch. I started only going there when I know I can take leftovers with me.\\n\\nI do love the fact they have so many veggies and tofu! As a vegetarian this is one of my go to places. The tofu is not super firm and rubbery like at Pei Wei. I like being able to create my own meal and it's always super fresh tasting.\\n\\nThe employees there are super nice too. They remember you and have always been hard working.\n\n## emotion:\nSatisfied\n"}

Firstly, they give you massive servings, and when I say massive I mean it. They have good friendly service. Lastly, and of course they have killer food. Surprisingly, since they resemble and English pub, they also have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options! The vegan options are also not just a \\\"veggie burger\\\" or a salad. They have the real savory vegan dishes. I've had great vegan chili and I recommend the vegetable boxty, it was delicious. The only thing is if there is a game on it can get loud and crowded, it's not a huge place.\n\n## emotion:\nSatisfied\n"}

The wine list is very good and the presentation of the dishes was great. I was very hesitant to go there because when I called the place, they said the did not take reservations so that took me by surprise. Now, I understand why they don't take reservations since it is a very small place and they have basically communal tables. It is kind of like a tapas style type of place but they do offer large entrees as well.\\nThe duck fat fries are a MUST try (I assume they are always on the menu but you you may want to check). I'm unsure how often the menu changes but  have a feeling that it is at least weekly.\\nI fully recommend this place for a fun experience and a reasonable option for fine dining.\n\n## emotion:\nSatisfied\n"}

Everything was nice and tender. The consistency was thinner than any other green curries I have tried and the level of spiciness was right. My boyfriend had a red curry with duck and he said it was ok. The service was friendly and attentive.\n\n## emotion:\nSatisfied\n"}

Right?\n[ai]: I don't want to remember something.\n[user]: Hope for some things.\n[ai]: Right. I got it. Of course.

Anyhow, they were very small ones.\n[user]: It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.\n[ai]: You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.\n[user]: It's become a habit with you.\n[ai]: You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.\n[user]: Oh, don't be so stupid.\n[ai]: Really, Amanda\n[user]: What?\n[ai]: Nothing.\n[user]: Going out somewhere, my dear?\n[ai]: No, just making myself fascinating for you\n[user]: Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.\n[ai]: The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?\n[user]: As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.\n[ai]: Oh, no, it isn't.\n[user]: Yes, it is.\n[ai]: Oh, be quiet.\n[user]: Line?\n[ai]: It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.\n[user]: It's a pity -- what?\n[ai]: It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.\n[user]: It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.\n[ai]: Line?\n[user]: Snap.\n[ai]: Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.\n[user]: Adders don't snap, they sting.\n[ai]: They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.\n[user]: They sting.\n[ai]: They snap.\n[user]: I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.\n[ai]: Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?\n[user]: Yes, I did, quite a lot.\n[ai]: I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?\n[user]: Mind your own business.\n[ai]: You must have had a riotous time.\n[user]: No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.\n[ai]: You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.\n[user]: I'm not in the least drunk.\n[ai]: You always had a weak head.\n[user]: I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.\n[ai]: On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.\n[user]: Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?\n[ai]: Oh, shut up.\n[user]: We might get up a splendid little- a splendid little debate about this, you know, intemperate tots.\n[ai]: Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.\n[user]: Very good idea.  I will\n[ai]: You better turn that off I think.\n[user]: Why?\n[ai]: It's late and the people upstairs will get annoyed.\n[user]: There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.\n[ai]: There are people downstairs, I suppose\n[user]: They're away in Tunis.\n[ai]: This is no time of year for Tunis.\n[user]: Turn it on again, please.\n[ai]: I will do no such thing.\n[user]: Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.\n[ai]: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.\n[user]: Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.\n[ai]: Turn it off.\n[user]: You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.\n[ai]: We swapped. Listen.\n[user]: Listen--\n[ai]: Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.\n[user]: You're a vile tempered, loosed living\n[ai]: Stop.\n[user]: wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.\n[ai]: Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.\n[user]: This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.\n[ai]: You're not going like this.\n[user]: Oh, yes, I am.\n[ai]: No, you're not.\n[user]: Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.\n[ai]: Shut up. Shut up.\n[user]: You're a mean, evil minded\n[ai]: Marry you again? Huh.\n[user]: little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.\n[ai]: Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment.

Well, um- the f.\n[user]: Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-\n[ai]: Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know\n[user]: Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-\n[ai]: For some reason, so you think it won't show up?\n[user]: Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that\n[ai]: Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.\n[user]: What? What? How does that happen?\n[ai]: Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.\n[user]: I really - I really need that bag.\n[ai]: I- I- I understand, but um.\n[user]: there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got\n[ai]: Okay\n[user]: I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there\n[ai]: Right.\n[user]: It's worth a lot.\n[ai]: I understand that.

I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and\n[ai]: see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-\n[user]: Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.\n[ai]: Theft?\n[user]: Um, so.\n[ai]: Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-\n[user]: We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know\n[ai]: I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.\n[user]: This is unbelievable.

Can you check again? [garbage]\n[user]: I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar.\n[ai]: Fifty- fifty dollars? Come on you have got to be joking.\n[user]: Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-\n[ai]: Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on\n[user]: that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.\n[ai]: The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-\n[user]: The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-\n[ai]: Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have\n[user]: we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-\n[ai]: I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do\n[user]: because this is ridiculous?\n[ai]: I'm sorry. I don't- I-\n[user]: I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-\n[ai]: All right.

When you pay for something, there should be some sort of guarantee that it's gonna come through.\n[ai]: You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.

What do you want, a diagram?\n[user]: No, I don't want a diagram.\n[ai]: He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?\n[user]: Okay. All right, then.\n[ai]: Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.\n[user]: No, I've given it three years of thought.\n[ai]: And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.\n[user]: But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.\n[ai]: What the hell is this?\n[user]: I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.\n[ai]: You're crazy.\n[user]: I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.\n[ai]: You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?\n[user]: The business. The business doesn't inspire me.\n[ai]: Oh, you have to be inspired.\n[user]: Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.\n[ai]: Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.\n[user]: Now, where do I find it?\n[ai]: Tell me something.\n[user]: You'd leave that business.\n[ai]: Yes. On this I would.\n[user]: You can't do that.\n[ai]: Then help me stay here.\n[user]: All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.\n[ai]: Okay. Just-\n[user]: We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you.\n[ai]: Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?\n[user]: I'm going to.\n[ai]: You just can't talk like that.\n[user]: I am thinking like that.\n[ai]: I don't know you, do I?\n[user]: No, you don't.

All right, then, Mom.\n[ai]: I just--give it some more thought.\n[user]: I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.\n[ai]: But if I can't--if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.\n[user]: What the hell is this?\n[ai]: I'll get out.  I'll get married and go live some place else.  Maybe New York.\n[user]: Are you crazy?\n[ai]: I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.\n[user]: What about the business?

Watch me, won't you, a minute?\n[ai]: As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.\n[user]: No, it isn't.\n[ai]: Yes, it is.\n[user]: No, it's not. I don't care.\n[ai]: It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.\n[user]: Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?\n[ai]: Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.\n[user]: Adders don't snap, they sting.\n[ai]: Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.\n[user]: They sting.\n[ai]: They snap.\n[user]: I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.\n[ai]: Uhh,\n[user]: did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?\n[ai]: Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.\n[user]: I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?\n[ai]: Mind your business.\n[user]: You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.\n[ai]: You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.\n[user]: I'm not in the least bit drunk.\n[ai]: You've always had a weak head.\n[user]: Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.\n[ai]: On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.\n[user]: Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.\n[ai]: Do shut up. Shut up.\n[user]: I don't want to talk about this anymore.\n[ai]: You better turn that off.\n[user]: Why?\n[ai]: It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.\n[user]: There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.\n[ai]: Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.\n[user]: They're away in Tunis.\n[ai]: This is no time of the year for Tunis.\n[user]: Turn it on again, please.\n[ai]: No, I will do no such thing.\n[user]: Turn it on.\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.\n[ai]: Turn it off.\n[user]: I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.\n[ai]: Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-\n[user]: Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.\n[ai]: Very amusing indeed.\n[user]: Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.\n[ai]: You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.\n[user]: This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.\n[ai]: No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.\n[user]: Oh, yes I am.\n[ai]: Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.\n[user]: Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.\n[ai]: I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.\n[user]: Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.\n\n## emotion:\nangry\n"}

Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.\n[user]: Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;\n[ai]: Do you remember the first time we came to see it?\n[user]: uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.\n[ai]: Uh.\n[user]: It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.\n[ai]: And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.\n[user]: Wait a minute, I've got it.\n[ai]: Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.\n[user]: It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.\n[ai]: I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.\n[user]: Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: You want to get some champagne?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: What, you want me to breathe in your ear?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: You want to get married again?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: What, you want a divorce?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: A vacation?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: A new carpet?  A poodle?  An ice cream?  A back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What, Carla?  What the hell do you want?\n[ai]: I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.\n[user]: Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.\n[ai]: No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.\n[user]: And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.\n[ai]: This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.\n[user]: Yes, it is.\n[ai]: Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.\n[user]: Right.\n[ai]: But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.\n[user]: No, I know, me neither.\n[ai]: This is just this.  I mean, it includes a lot and everything, but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?\n[user]: I'm doing the best I can.\n[ai]: I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.\n[user]: Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?\n[ai]: I didn't say that.\n[user]: No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.\n[ai]: For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.\n[user]: Yeah?\n[ai]: Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.\n[user]: Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.\n[ai]: Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.\n[user]: I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.\n[ai]: Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.\n[user]: Shh.

Are you on your period?\n[ai]: Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.\n[user]: Okay, well then what's bugging you?\n[ai]: I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.\n[user]: Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish.\n[ai]: Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.\n[user]: And then we go home and they go home.\n[ai]: Why not?\n[user]: Because they never do.

I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is.\n[ai]: Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.\n[user]: you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.\n[ai]: Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the \"the Grunions are running tonight,\" and I said \"okay great, let's go.\"\n[user]: So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--\n[ai]: Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.\n[user]: We thought I was pregnant we had this bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance so we took off our shoes.\n[ai]: While we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me, right into my ears so I could feel them much as hear them.\n[user]: And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.\n[ai]: Wait a minute, I've got it.\n[user]: Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.\n[ai]: It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said \"let's get some champagne\" and I said \"no time to wasting\" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?\n[user]: You want this to be like the other times, right?\n[ai]: I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.\n[user]: Oh right sure, of course.\n[ai]: Do you want to dance?\n[user]: No.\n[ai]: You want me to go get some champagne?\n[user]: No.\n[ai]: Do you want to take off our shoes?\n[user]: No.\n[ai]: What? Huh?\n[user]: You want to get married again?\n[ai]: What?  What?  You want to divorce?\n[user]: No.\n[ai]: A vacation?\n[user]: No.\n[ai]: A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?\n[user]: I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.\n[ai]: Well, welcome to the human race.\n[user]: You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.\n[ai]: You think there would be times when you'd look at me like I was used Kleenex and then I'd look at you and think \"Holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska.\"\n[user]: No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--\n[ai]: No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.\n[user]: This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.\n[ai]: Yeah, it is.\n[user]: Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.\n[ai]: Right.\n[user]: This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.\n[ai]: I know me neither.\n[user]: This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?\n[ai]: I'm doing the best I can.\n[user]: I know that Augie, I really do.\n[ai]: I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.\n[user]: Maybe if you were with somebody else too?\n[ai]: I didn't say that.\n[user]: No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.\n[ai]: Are you kidding me?  For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.\n[user]: Yeah?\n[ai]: Yes, don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?\n[user]: You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.\n[ai]: Actually, you know what?  Now you mentioned that--no I don't.\n[user]: So maybe we're in the wrong spot.  But we're with the right person.\n[ai]: I don't know, just seemed like such a good spot to me.\n[user]: We do have really good view of the moon from here though.\n[ai]: Oh I saw that.  Pretty isn't it. Big ol' white moon.\n[user]: Look what we got here.\n[ai]: Augie, you brought refreshments.\n[user]: It's not champagne.\n[ai]: I guess we don't need glasses.\n[user]: Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?\n[ai]: I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.\n[user]: Augie, I'm sorry.\n[ai]: Shh...\n[user]: If we are really quiet, the fish might come.\n[ai]: Or not.\n[user]: Or not.\n\n## emotion:\nneutral\n"}

I know they would, especially your mother.\n[user]: How did you know?\n[ai]: Well what other reason, from her point of view, would I be coming here?\n[user]: So, would you want to?\n[ai]: I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.\n[user]: Well,\n[ai]: Oh Annie.  I love you.  I love you a great deal.\n[user]: I love you.\n[ai]: I guess that's why I came.\n[user]: I don't...I have no imagination that's the only way I know how to tell it.\n[ai]: I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell you this here.  I wanted to drive someplace brand new where we'd be brand new to each other.  It feels wrong here don't you?\n[user]: This yard and this chair.  I don't want to win you from anything, I want you to be ready for me.\n[ai]: Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.\n[user]: Then he's gone forever, you sure?\n[ai]: Look, I almost got married two years ago.\n[user]: Why didn't you?\n[ai]: You started to write me.\n[user]: You felt something that far back.\n[ai]: Every day since.\n[user]: Why didn't you let me know?\n[ai]: I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?\n[user]: You'd always be so ambiguous.\n[ai]: Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...\n[user]: Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.\n[ai]: I'll never forgive you for that.\n[user]: How long, how long I've been waiting to do that.\n[ai]: I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.\n[user]: We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.\n[ai]: Not like that you're not.\n[user]: I kissed you.\n[ai]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.\n[user]: Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.\n[ai]: What is it?\n[user]: No, what is it?  Your mother?\n[ai]: No, nothing, nothing like that.\n[user]: Tell me what's wrong.

They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.\n[user]: A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.\n[ai]: It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?\n[user]: And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.\n[ai]: And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.\n[user]: And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.\n[ai]: It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,\n[user]: open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator\n[ai]: cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.\n[user]: Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.\n[ai]: And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.\n[user]: And you still feel that way?\n[ai]: I want you now Annie.\n[user]: Cause you must not feel that way again.  You hear me?  You can't.  You deserve everything you have Chris.\n[ai]: that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.

Do you have any proof?\n[ai]: For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.\n[user]: To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?\n[ai]: Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.\n[user]: It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--\n[ai]: All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?\n[user]: Why?\n[ai]: You know.\n[user]: Well I got an idea, but what's your story?\n[ai]: I'm going to ask her to marry me.\n[user]: Well that's only your business, Chris.\n[ai]: You know it's not just my business.\n[user]: Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.\n[ai]: So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?\n[user]: Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --\n[ai]: Then it's not just my business.\n[user]: I'm just saying.\n[ai]: You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.\n[user]: Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.\n[ai]: She's not Larry's girl.\n[user]: Line.\n[ai]: From mother's point of view, he's not dead.\n[user]: From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.\n[ai]: Now you can go on from here.\n[user]: Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.\n[ai]: I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.\n[user]: You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.\n[ai]: To hell with that.\n[user]: I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?\n[ai]: I wanted to get this settled first.\n[user]: Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.\n[ai]: Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.\n[user]: And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.\n[ai]: The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.\n[user]: So what.  I'm not fast with women.\n[ai]: Why does it have to be Annie?\n[user]: Because it is.\n[ai]: Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.\n[user]: I don't know.\n[ai]: You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.\n[user]: I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.\n[ai]: Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?\n[user]: I don't want a diagram.\n[ai]: He thinks he's coming back Chris.\n[user]: You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...\n[ai]: ...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.\n[user]: All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]\n[ai]: Just give it some more thought.\n[user]: I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.\n[ai]: But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.\n[user]: What the hell is this?\n[ai]: I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.\n[user]: Are you crazy?\n[ai]: I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.\n[user]: You have a business here.  What the hell is this?\n[ai]: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.\n[user]: Oh.  Must you be inspired?\n[ai]: Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.\n[user]: I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.

I don't know what happened--\n[user]: Are you going to refund us for our luggage, refund us for our tickets for this?\n[ai]: We- I mean-\n[user]: Well, we can give you um- hotel lodging for a night if that--\n[ai]: I'm going to San Diego tomorrow to stay with my family.  What do I need hotel lodging for hmmm?  Can you tell me that?\n[user]: For tonight- For tonight sir.  Would you need to stay somewhere tonight?\n[ai]: Tonight no.  I'm driving tomorrow.  Tonight I'm staying with a friend alright?  I don't need hotel reservations...where?  What hotel?\n[user]: We can do Holiday Inn or...?\n[ai]: Wow.  Thank you.  Holiday Inn.  Wow.  Thank...the flight cost five hundred dollars.\n[user]: Sir I understand that but just--\n[ai]: Okay, so you can put me in Holiday Inn for twenty dollar a night?\n[user]: Did you have your name tags on the luggage?\n[ai]: Of course I had my name tags on the luggage.\n[user]: Okay.  So if you can just give me your name, your name and your address and your phone number I can contact you as soon as we find out more information.\n[ai]: Soon as you...that's not good enough okay?\n[user]: Sir, please calm down.\n[ai]: I need you to help me out here.  Can you get on the phone and get the luggage over on the fastest flight you can and then maybe I won't get you fired.\n[user]: If not, I'm going to get your name, I'm going to talk to your boss, whoever...I'm never going to fly...my business is never going to fly Delta again.\n[ai]: Okay.\n[user]: What is your business?\n[ai]: I work for IBM.\n[user]: Okay.  Sir?  I am sorry to tell you this but this does happen. Uh- This is not uh- really,\n[ai]: I mean, our airline's fault.  I don't know what happened, misplaced, something happened but we will get you--\n[user]: You misplace a lot of, eight pieces of luggage.\n[ai]: Well, the entire flight, sir, the luggage was placed on another plane that never actually left Baltimore.\n[user]: Uh no I'm not.\n[ai]: Are you kidding me?\n[user]: Who are you going to fire because of that?\n[ai]: Well we have some people back there that need some firing so, but I would just really appreciate--\n[user]: Wow.  This has never happened before.  I've not lost,\n[ai]: in all thousand flights I've been on probably I can't even count how many flights I've been on.  This has never happened before.\n[user]: This is the worst customer service I've ever gotten before.\n[ai]: Yeah.\n[user]: Okay sir.  I'm sorry you can--um-\n[ai]: Okay.  Get on the phone and figure out where my luggage is and tell me when it's going to get there alright?\n[user]: We already have been confirmed that it will be arriving in--uh--in about two days.\n[ai]: And and, in about...\n[user]: Two days I'll be in San Diego and how's it going to get to me in San Diego?  You going to make sure it gets to the San Diego airport?\n[ai]: Uh, we can't--\n[user]: Can you get it to the San Diego airport?  You get someone to drive it to my place alright? Then I get a refund for some...I get a free flight alright? I get free whatever.\n[ai]: Yes sir, Yes.\n[user]: We can have them direct your luggage to San Diego.\n[ai]: Okay.  And you're going to give me what for my inconvenience?\n[user]: Uh--\n[ai]: Some refreshments in the lobby?\n[user]: Some peanuts?  Wow.  That helps a lot.\n[ai]: Thanks you, thank you I don't have my luggage so you gave me a Holiday Inn stay and peanuts.  Wow.  You know what?\n[user]: eh- we actually--\n[ai]: I will never do business with Delta again.\n\n## emotion:\nsad\n"}

I'm gonna make you so happy.\n[user]: Not like that you're not.\n[ai]: I kissed you.\n[user]: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?\n[ai]: Let's drive someplace.

It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.\n[user]: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.\n[ai]: No, I didn't.

Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?\n[ai]: No, thanks.\n[user]: I think I'll have some.\n[ai]: Don't see why you want any.  You've already had two glasses.\n[user]: No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.\n[ai]: Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.\n[user]: You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.\n[ai]: Well, it's become a habit with you.\n[user]: You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.\n[ai]: Don't be so stupid.\n[user]: Really, Amanda.\n[ai]: What?\n[user]: Nothing.\n[ai]: Going out somewhere dear?\n[user]: No, just making myself fascinating for you.\n[ai]: That reply has broken my heart.\n[user]: A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?\n[ai]: As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.\n[user]: No, it isn't.\n[ai]: Yes, it is.\n[user]: Oh, be quiet.\n[ai]: Ah, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.\n[user]: Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.\n[ai]: Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.\n[user]: Adders don't snap, they sting.\n[ai]: Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.\n[user]: They sting.\n[ai]: They snap.\n[user]: I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.\n[ai]: Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?\n[user]: Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.\n[ai]: Hmm, I imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then.\n[user]: Mind your own business.\n[ai]: Oh, must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all.  Very enjoyable and never had much anyhow.\n[user]: You're quite insufferable\n[ai]: I expect it's because you're drunk.\n[user]: I'm not in the least drunk.\n[ai]: You've always had a weak head.\n[user]: As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.\n[ai]: On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.\n[user]: Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?\n[ai]: Shut up.\n[user]: We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.\n[ai]: Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.\n[user]: All right.  I will.\n[ai]: You better turn that off, I think.\n[user]: Why?\n[ai]: Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.\n[user]: There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.\n[ai]: There are people downstairs I suppose?\n[user]: They're away in Tunis.\n[ai]: This is no time of the year for Tunis.\n[user]: Turn it on again, please.\n[ai]: I'll do no such thing.\n[user]: Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.\n[ai]: Turn it off.

I want to talk to you.\n[ai]: The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--\n[user]: Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?\n[ai]: Why?\n[user]: You know.\n[ai]: Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?\n[user]: I'm going to ask her to marry me.\n[ai]: Well, that's only your business, Chris.\n[user]: You know it's not just my business.\n[ai]: Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.\n[user]: So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?\n[ai]: You want to make sure that your father's not going to...\n[user]: See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?\n[ai]: I'm just saying.\n[user]: I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.\n[ai]: She is not Larry's girl.\n[user]: From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.

See, I don't know.\n[ai]: I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.

Maybe she feels same way your father does.\n[ai]: Well, if she does then that's the end of it.

I'm just--I'm not fast with women.\n[user]: I don't see why it has to be Annie.\n[ai]: Because it is.\n[user]: That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.\n[ai]: I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.\n[user]: He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.\n[ai]: Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.\n[user]: All right then.\n[ai]: Give it some more thought.\n[user]: I've given it lots of thought.

I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.\n[user]: Are you crazy?\n[ai]: I'll do it.\n[user]: You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?\n[ai]: Business?

It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.\n[user]: Are we talking about the same thing?\n[ai]: Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.\n[user]: Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?\n[ai]: God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.\n[user]: Well, what's bugging you?\n[ai]: We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.\n[user]: There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.\n[ai]: For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.\n[user]: Why not?\n[ai]: We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?\n[user]: We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.\n[ai]: Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.\n[user]: Well, we'll see them this year.\n[ai]: No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.\n[user]: I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.\n[ai]: I thought you wanted to see it.\n[user]: You don't understand anything I'm saying.\n[ai]: No, of course not.\n[user]: I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.\n[ai]: It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.\n[user]: For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.\n[ai]: All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.\n[user]: I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.\n[ai]: You said, \"Hey the grunion are running tonight.\"  I said, \"Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.\"\n[user]: Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--\n[ai]: Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.\n[user]: I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.\n[ai]: And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.\n[user]: And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.\n[ai]: Wait a minute.  I've got it.\n[user]: Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.\n[ai]: It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, \"let's get some champagne,\" and I said, \"time's a wasting\" or something like that, right?\n[user]: Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?\n[ai]: I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.\n[user]: Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: You want me to go get some champagne?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: Take off our shoes?\n[ai]: No. No.\n[user]: Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: You wanna get married again?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: What?  What?  You want a divorce?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: A vacation?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?\n[ai]: No.\n[user]: I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.\n[ai]: Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?\n[user]: No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?\n[ai]: No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us\n[user]: 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.\n[ai]: This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.\n[user]: Yes, it is.\n[ai]: Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.\n[user]: Right.\n[ai]: Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.\n[user]: I know, me neither.\n[ai]: I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?\n[user]: I'm doing the best I can.\n[ai]: I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.\n[user]: I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.\n[ai]: Maybe if you were with somebody else too.\n[user]: I didn't say that.\n[ai]: No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.\n[user]: Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.\n[ai]: Yeah?\n[user]: Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?\n[ai]: You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.\n[user]: Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.\n[ai]: Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.\n[user]: I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.\n[ai]: Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.\n[user]: Well, look what we have here.\n[ai]: Augie, you brought refreshments.\n[user]: It's not champagne.\n[ai]: Well, then we don't need glasses.\n[user]: You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?\n[ai]: No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.\n[user]: Augie, I'm sorry.\n[ai]: Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.\n[user]: Or not.\n[ai]: Or not.\n\n## emotion:\nsad\n"}

Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.\n[user]: How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.\n[ai]: I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?

Our blanket.\n[user]: This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.\n[ai]: I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.\n[user]: You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?\n[ai]: I'm cold.\n[user]: Do you want my jacket?\n[ai]: It's after eleven, let's just go home.\n[user]: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.\n[ai]: There is no point in coming down here.\n[user]: Right.\n[ai]: That's my point.\n[user]: That's my point too.\n[ai]: So, let's go.\n[user]: No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?\n[ai]: Not particularly.\n[user]: Why not?\n[ai]: I just don't.  It's stupid.\n[user]: Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.\n[ai]: Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.\n[user]: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.\n[ai]: Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,\n[user]: this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.\n[ai]: What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.\n[user]: Yeah they do.\n[ai]: Ah, Augie.\n[user]: Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.\n[ai]: There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.\n[user]: I'm just not.\n[ai]: For real?\n[user]: Yeah.\n[ai]: I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.\n[user]: And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.\n[ai]: Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.\n[user]: We weren't in a good spot.\n[ai]: We didn't see them the first time either.\n[user]: We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.\n[ai]: There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?\n[user]: Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.\n[ai]: Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.\n[user]: They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-\n[ai]: all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.\n[user]: It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.\n[ai]: They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.\n[user]: Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.\n[ai]: That's the wind.\n[user]: Well, so what do you think?\n[ai]: About what?\n[user]: What I was saying.\n[ai]: It's ridiculous.\n\n## emotion:\nhappy\n"}

Our blanket.\n[ai]: You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.\n[user]: I'm so stupid.

I just don't.\n[user]: Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.\n[ai]: Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.\n[user]: Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.\n[ai]: I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.\n[user]: I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.\n[ai]: Yeah, they do.\n[user]: Oh, God, Augie.\n[ai]: What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.\n[user]: There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable.

And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.\n[user]: Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing.

And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.\n[ai]: And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way.

If I borrow let \u2019 s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?\n[user]: It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don \u2019 t default on a payment !\n[ai]: It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score .\n[user]: That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .\n[ai]: You know what ?

It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble?\n[ai]: Getting a job is not that difficult. But I try to find a job in my locality to avoid distant from family and having food issues.\n[user]: It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs?\n[ai]: Any kind of job, probably managerial. But to be in my locality since to look after my aged mom also.\n[user]: It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home?\n[ai]: I have been talking to some people who my friends knows also. They show interest but cannot help me on the issue.\n[user]: Surely they will refer to some people. But it will take some time.\n[ai]: Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you.

I am here because my friend talks way too much on the phone, and it frustrates me.\n[ai]: They never want to hang up, and the talk can literally go on for hours.\n[user]: It sounds like it would be quite frustrating for your friend to talk way too much on the phone.\n[ai]: No, he loves it! I'm the one who hates it.\n[user]: My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation?\n[ai]: I tell him, but he just doesn't get it. Or, he says he understands, but then just goes back to talking!\n[user]: Or, he may finally end the talk, but the next time we talk, he will just do it all over again!\n[ai]: I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk.\n[user]: Wow--that does sound annoying that he will repeat the same pattern the next time.\n[ai]: He will literally talk up to 10 minutes without letting you have a word in. As far as that advice, I have hung up, but he gets extremely offended easily.\n[user]: That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends.\n[ai]: I'm at my wits end. I tell him all the time. \"You talk too much. You gotta stop talking at me. You gotta give the other person a turn. You gotta respect other's time.\"\n[user]: What do you get out of the friendship with this other person?\n[ai]: Well, I've been friends with him for a long time. He's funny and can have interesting perspectives on things. Also, we have done a lot together in the past.\n[user]: That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?\n[ai]: Oh, yes, I have other friends in conversations who can take turns and understand the concept of time just fine.\n[user]: I just don't know what to do about this guy in particular. I still want to be his friend, but he just doesn't change.\n[ai]: I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him.\n[user]: Do you think I should just have a timer that goes off at 1 minute and let it beep in his face if he goes on for too long to train him like a monkey?\n[ai]: I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.\n[user]: I just need a method. Talking to him is just not working.\n[ai]: He is hard to condition.\n[user]: Would it hurt his feelings to use a timer like that? It may for some other people.\n[ai]: Yea, but I might be able to slip some humour in there to take the edge off because it is so silly.\n[user]: Humor is really helpful for a lot of people.\n[ai]: Any other ideas?\n[user]: Sometimes, people draw or do something else distracting with their hands when talking to someone who dominates the conversation.\n[ai]: So your option is to start just doing something else when he is talking? He might get the message in a subtle way?\n[user]: Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded.\n[ai]: The strategy works well for me with some of my family members who seem like they will never change. But, with distraction, I enjoy them all the more.\n[user]: This is true, and it isn't bade advice. Haha! That is funny. Yes, maybe I should find something to carry around with me that I can enjoy.\n[ai]: I don't really like to draw...\n[user]: Is there anything else that you like to do that would be distracting while also letting you somewhat participate in the conversation?\n[ai]: Yes, perhaps I should just use the internet when he starts talking too much.\n[user]: I have a phone.\n[ai]: That sounds really helpful. Sometimes people also play phone games or with a fidget spinner. I like your idea of looking on the internet.\n[user]: This solves the problem in person, but it doesn't solve the talks over the phone, but it has been 15 minutes now and this has been helpful enough. Thank you for your solutions. You have been very supportive and kind to me\n[ai]: I don't want to take up any more of your time. It has been a good conversation.\n[user]: You are very welcome.

I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and restrictions\n[ai]: I can agree. There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago. Which state do you live in?\n[user]: I'm actually from the UK. I live in the North of the country near Manchester and things are bad here right now.\n[ai]: I agree it's bad! Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again. I just keep thinking this is temporary!\n[user]: Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation\n[ai]: I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning. With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat. Are you able to hang out with friends?\n[user]: no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with?\n[ai]: Oh very much so! Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now. lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.\n[user]: Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself?\n[ai]: I downloaded Zoom around the end of May. The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call. It was so much fun despite the fact.\n[user]: Maybe organizing a \"zoom party\" would start to lift your spirits.\n[ai]: that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this?\n[user]: Depression sucks I have to say! Just don't let it win. Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.\n[ai]: Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also?\n[user]: Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do. Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom\n[ai]: Most definitely. Do you have Meetup over there?\n[user]: I've never heard of this, what is it?\n[ai]: It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself. Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups. I do it with a book club.\n[user]: I think something to take my mind off the current situation would be really good. I like the idea of a virtual book club. is it free?\n[ai]: Totally free!\n\n## act:\nInformation\n"}

I'm seeking some support, maybe some advice in dealing with a situation at my work.\n[user]: I've got a new supervisor who is so different from my last one.\n[ai]: Sure, I see you need some support at work because your new supervisor is so different than your previous one\n[user]: What kinds of things are troubling to you?\n[ai]: Yes. They have a Military background and bark orders, and change the way I'm working without being open to conversation.\n[user]: When I ask questions, they threaten my job. Telling me they \"Don't have to explain themselves!\" as they are my supervisor.\n[ai]: Wow, that sounds difficult with them being so militant. Have you been able to talk to any co-workers in a similar situation?\n[user]: Yes, there are two other people supervised by him. One of them is also Military and new him before hand, they seem to get along great.\n[ai]: But my other co-worker is like me. Doesn't know what to do, or who to turn to.\n[user]: Sometimes the work environment is pretty hostile when we're just trying to continue projects that were started before he arrived.\n[ai]: That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.\n[user]: Yea. But when he threatens and calls my insubordinate, I worry he might be making a case to remove me.\n[ai]: I wonder if I should talk to the person above him, about it.\n[user]: But I worry they might just think I'm complaining because its different\n[ai]: But it really is uncomfortable.\n[user]: It sounds like you worry about having your job taken away from you. Talking to someone above your supervisor may be a good solution.\n[ai]: Its been 3 months since he started, I just wonder if its too soon.\n[user]: I'd hate to be seen as a complainer.\n[ai]: And the person above him, is the person who hired him.\n[user]: When I was in a similar situation I had to go to a higher supervisor and was helped a lot. It probably is never too soon, but could be too late if you wait.\n[ai]: Thats true. I'm not happy at work, but I do love my job. I enjoyed it a lot before him arrived. But now I'm constantly thinking about finding a new job, or worrying about him pushing me out. Maybe thats what he wants, so he can bring in his own people?\n[user]: I see you really like your job. Sometimes just taking a deep breath can help to calm stress.\n[ai]: Thats good advice. I do need to do more outside of work to relieve the stress.\n[user]: I'll try to do that. Do you think I can speak to him about his tone and maybe explain that communication is much more relaxed?\n[ai]: Do you think he'll be receptive to your communications if you speak directly to him?\n[user]: I think its worth a try, but I don't want him to think I'm being argumentative. Any suggestions on how to have that conversation?\n[ai]: I can see that you worry about your boss seeing you as argumentative, but could you try it from the perspective of making your boss feel like he is in control?\n[user]: Making it his idea. That's a good tactic. I could try that.\n[ai]: And maybe giving him time to understand the workplace as it new to him too.\n[user]: Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n[ai]: I think you've given me some good advice.\n[user]: Thank you.\n[ai]: I feel a little less anxious than I did.\n[user]: You are welcome.\n[ai]: I appreciate it!\n[user]: I wish you well.\n\n## act:\nAffirmation and Reassurance\n"}

My friends invite me out but I never feel like going.\n[user]: After a three year relationship, you're going to have a period of mourning. This happens whether the breakup was right or wrong. It's still a huge part of your life now separated, and that's an important life event.\n[ai]: Yeah that makes sense. It's just hard you know. What steps should I take to feel better?\n[user]: I think it would be good for you to go out with your friends. Sometimes when you're really down, you might not feel like it. Going out takes effort, but it's worth it.\n[ai]: Okay I'll try to make an effort to go out more.\n[user]: Isolating at home is not going to help you process things.

Anyone there?\n[user]: Hi sorry\n[ai]: I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis\n[user]: Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?\n[ai]: In about a month.\n[user]: I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.\n[ai]: Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?\n[user]: Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.\n[ai]: Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.\n[user]: Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.\n[ai]: That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper.\n[user]: It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week.\n[ai]: Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.\n[user]: My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research.\n[ai]: Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself, a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that\n[user]: You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.\n[ai]: That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable.\n[user]: That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused.\n[ai]: I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess.\n[user]: Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.\n[ai]: My advisor is a tough woman, I'm not going to beat around the bush. She tends to make everything miserable.\n[user]: Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!\n\n## act:\nAffirmation and Reassurance\n"}

He was really just fine in July.\n[user]: It seems like he was in a lot of pain adn discomfort so surgery should really help.\n[ai]: That's what we are hoping. He was sort of stubborn about talking to the surgeon this week for advice, but finally listened to me.\n[user]: Yeah, it really comes out of nowhere.

I'm so relieved, with the covid restrictions. but I can.\n[ai]: I think only one visitor at a time, but he moved her to be close to me (met long distance), so his closest friends aren't local.

I'm happy for both of you.\n[ai]: It's just a strange year. I lost both my dogs to cancer in six months, then this. Then my cousin died of pancreatic in July.

You really deserve a break.\n[ai]: She did ! Especially when she was in treatment.\n[user]: Right, and as I bet you can relate, breaks are hard to get in COVID days.\n[ai]: that's what's scary, is right now, he's not in treatment. They think because of the cancer's location and the type, that surgery is the better option. So it's really just the cancer that is doing this to him.\n[user]: Definitely hard. You'll have to try to find something for you to relax. Even if it's just walking or reading.\n[ai]: That's one thing COVID has been good for. Lots of long walks with friends.\n[user]: Yes!

This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi. Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently.\n[ai]: OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user.

I will find it difficult to sustain if this continues like this for other 3 months.\n[user]: So it sounds like you've been struggling with finding a new job. It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble?\n[ai]: Getting a job is not that difficult. But I try to find a job in my locality to avoid distant from family and having food issues.\n[user]: It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs?\n[ai]: Any kind of job, probably managerial. But to be in my locality since to look after my aged mom also.\n[user]: It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home?\n[ai]: I have been talking to some people who my friends knows also. They show interest but cannot help me on the issue.\n[user]: Surely they will refer to some people. But it will take some time.\n[ai]: Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't.\n[user]: Thanks for making confidence. I feel relaxed. I believe this will surely be a chance to find myself and get a better opportunity to be relieved from my previous difficulties. Only GOD should have forced me this way, I believe.\n[ai]: Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.\n[user]: I felt anger over my previous employer since he was not giving any time for me to switch over, at least 2 months.\n[ai]: Even then he was satisfied till then.\n[user]: It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore.

Just daily stresses such as disrupted life routines from the pandemic and growing anxiety as my city is facing the beginning of the second wave.\n[ai]: i surely understand you. this pandemic has been really stressful.\n[user]: yeah you bet\n[ai]: for example, I only go out once or twice a week for my job, and once every two weeks for groceries. And that's it. But even then, when I have to be in close quarters with coworkers and even to go out for groceries, that scares me.\n[user]: yeah, people are not social distancing enough.\n[ai]: but wearing a mask and then using sanitizer should at least give us a bit of a confidence\n[user]: like it was only this tuesday when my city finally acknowledge there's community spread and second wave, when it has been happening slowly for the last two weeks!\n[ai]: it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information. And they are still not shutting down gyms or restaurants, when they are the main sources right now in my city.\n[user]: at least now i hope the city will put in more restrictions and mandate mask wearing.\n[ai]: yeah I have been doing all that, with the washing of the hands and so forth. The situation at my job is unavoidable but I am still as careful as I try to cope.\n[user]: well, it's only today they brought the limit to social gatherings from 10 to 5.\n[ai]: have you tried reaching out to mayor's office to see if there is any way you could request for more restrictions. most of the cities do have a hotline or a channel for residents to give suggestions or request something\n[user]: too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down selective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc.\n[ai]: hmm, that's a bummer.\n[user]: yeah there's a local line but it's a pretty big city and it wouldn't really matter what I say\n[ai]: okay\n[user]: but anyhow, I have been conferring with my friend pretty much daily on the phone and that does help with social support.\n[ai]: But thanks for that advice, it's a good idea\n[user]: that's great. having a supportive friend\/family is so much a blessing during this pandemic\n[ai]: yes definitely, since I live alone and pretty much self isolated since March of this year.\n[user]: I have gotten used to it and more comfortable. Before I was more nervous, lonely, and claustrophobic. It is better now but my fear is coming back due to the rising cases.\n[ai]: yeah, i can understand.\n[user]: do you have any hobbies or interests that you can work on to help you put your mind away for sometime?\n[ai]: yeah thanks for listening. And this does impact my daily routines, from my workout patterns, sleep patterns, and diet.\n[user]: yeah somewhat\n[ai]: but not productive energy. I tend to be lethargic, immobile at my computer for long times, surfing the net aimlessly when I should be studying, and just distracted.\n[user]: there are a good number of online forums for most of the hobbies\/interests.. that'll help you share your work and also get some additional ideas\n[ai]: and I sleep real late and wake up real late. It's all backwards and unhealthy and I am disappointed in myself. I also work out less because I can work out at home but I have done that less and less as somehow I don't feel motivated.\n[user]: okay yeah good idea.\n[ai]: I can look for more videos too on such resources\n[user]: like I don't play any musical instruments but that would be great for a distraction like that or to pass time or to improve on a craft or project.\n[ai]: putting away my phone has helped me a lot. also, i have designed a daily routine to include more of the tasks that i like\n[user]: Just pretty much my studies with two online courses and not even reading anything outside of school. And even then, my school work ethics suck and I am kind of disappointed at my lapses that way.\n[ai]: ok yeah great ideas\n[user]: yeah, try to start learning a new musical instrument of your choice. maybe just 30-60 mins everyday.\n[ai]: I have started to put away my phone\n[user]: as I realize that I use it a lot too\n[ai]: nice\n[user]: So I put it at the opposite end of my room for example\n[ai]: started doing that lately and so the screen time has reduced somewhat\n[user]: so just trying to channel my productive energy into finishing school deadlines\n[ai]: social media and then this relentless flow of covid news\/info is also stressful\n[user]: yeah for sure, especially following up news from around the world and in the states\n[ai]: just stressful loads of news just catching up to daily events\n[user]: and as for daily schedule, yes I have kind of more control on that too as I try to write down what I should do now and set an alarm to start doing this at this time etc, especially in juggling my school work.\n[ai]: but yeah your ideas are great and match my thinking exactly\n[user]: yepp. i read a book - 'atomic habits'. and kind of designed a daily routine. this helping me a lot and reducing stress as well.\n\n## act:\nSelf-disclosure\n"}

There should be some permanent solution for it.\n[user]: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.\n[ai]: We can still hope for the best right now.

The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that .\n[user]: So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .\n[ai]: It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it \u2019 s harder to make peace between countries .\n[user]: Yes . It is .

If I borrow let \u2019 s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?\n[user]: It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don \u2019 t default on a payment !\n[ai]: It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score .\n[user]: That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .\n[ai]: You know what ?

Not really, as I did not buy any expensive gifts etc\n[user]: I am glad to hear that .. too many people think they have to spend too much.

How are you today?\n[user]: not very good.\n[ai]: oh no. that isn't good. can you tell me what happened?\n[user]: my husband and i have been fighting alot recently over his infidelity\n[ai]: its really taken a toll on me. we have tried several counselors but nothing seems to be working\n[user]: I am sorry to hear that. I can understand how frustrating that can be. I have had my fair share of boyfriends cheat on me.\n[ai]: weve been married for 14 years. I feel broken by this. we have 2 kids and my daughter, the eldest knows\n[user]: I am sure that you have been trying to do everything that you can do to help the situation. It sounds like you choosing counseling was a good start. It shows how much you care.\n[ai]: yes but my husband doesnt want to fi things. hes happy with having 2 women\n[user]: ive had to buy a recorder and put it in his car. The things i heard were horrible.\n[ai]: he found out though.\n[user]: It is rough for our children to see adult stuff like this. They might not be able to understand. I would suggest trying to set down and talk to them about it, when you are ready.\n[ai]: I dont want my youngest to know. He loves his father and i dont want to destroy that\n[user]: How do you feel about your husband not wanting to fix things? Is that something that you are considering?\n[ai]: i feel horrible. Im actually trying to fix things while he texts her every day\n[user]: i dont know whats gonna happen\n[ai]: That is a very thoughtful thing for you to put your son first. He is lucky to have such a great mother, that obviously loves him.\n[user]: i do very much\n[ai]: Have you tried to talk to your husband about your feelings and how you might not be willing to accept this?\n[user]: i do but every time i do he thinks that its that i dont trust him and that i hate him\n[ai]: and i dont hate him or his lover. I just want things to go back they used to be.\n[user]: what should i do?\n[ai]: Have you thought about if you can trust him after that?\n[user]: im not sure if i can, but i dont want to live in constant paranoia of him\n[ai]: im just so lost\n[user]: I can understand where you are coming from. I have been in that situation myself and it is not an easy place to be. For me, it took some time to accept that I deserved better than someone who didn't just want me. Is that how you feel?\n[ai]: kind of\n[user]: Understandably so. I believe that this is just temporary and you will be amazed at how strong you are.\n[ai]: you think so?\n[user]: If you are leaning toward not accepting not being enough for him, then I would suggest an exit plan. Call a family member, or friend, to see if you can stay there awhile. Have a cooling off period from your husband and reassess the situation\n[ai]: ok. ill consider that\n[user]: thank you so much\n[ai]: this has been going on for half a year\n[user]: I absolutely do. We normally find out that we are actually much stronger than we give ourselves credit for.\n[ai]: thank you\n[user]: That is wonderful news!

I myself have been in the position of loss of income and financial insecurity in the past, and while it was hard while I was in the valley, I was able to walk out of it with some valuable lessons.\n[ai]: That is true, I just have to work hard for myself. I am learning valuable lessons like the idea that companies don't care about their workers, etc. Working more on myself sounds like the better option.\n[user]: It sounds like you are already identifying areas of self improvement. A person with confidence in themselves and the ability to reflect and grow are promising attributes potential employers look for.\n[ai]: Thank you for all that you've done today, I couldn't get through it without you dude.\n[user]: Thank you for your time today, hearing my concerns about the future!\n[ai]: You are so welcome. I know that you will succeed in your employment search as you have the skills and humility that potential employers are looking for.\n[user]: I'll continue to keep on the lookout for new job opportunities, as well as improving myself for the long term. I appreciate it!\n[ai]: As you continue your job search, can you think of ways that you could trim your cost of living for the short term? Returning to the basics for a time could help save you money while you take the next steps with your career. Things like planning meals ahead of time, using items you already have instead of buying new, letting go of subscriptions you don't use daily or don't deem necessary.\n[user]: I could definitely reduce my spending like going out less for fast food, cutting my Netflix and Hulu subscriptions, and prepare my own meals for the next week weeks, as I try to find a new job. This would definitely help with my concerns about income and financial security.\n[ai]: Our lifestyle seems to be all about convenience and instant gratification, I myself being guilty of wanting those as well. But I think when we strip our needs down to the basics for a while we allow ourselves to find what is really necessary, as well as what is truly important to us.\n[user]: Very true, people definitely need to find their fitting for when things go wrong. Failure or bad events give us time to think about the important things in life, as well as our true needs.\n[ai]: And it is important to remember that everyone goes through cycles of feast or famine, and that when you are walking through a famine you yourself are not a failure. As long as you know you are doing your best to succeed under the circumstances you have been handed, you will never truly be a failure to yourself or to others.\n"}

But I've found myself depressed from working from home all the time.\n[user]: Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated.

I was working from home just 1 day per week prior to that, which I liked. But I've found that 5 days per week is much too much. I miss people. :(\n[user]: Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work.\n[ai]: That's where it gets awkward.

I am afraid my children will forget me.\n[ai]: So, just to clarify, you are going through a hard divorce with your ex-wife and this has you feeling very down..\n[user]: ex-husband\n[ai]: yes\n[user]: Sorry about that, ex-husband.\n[ai]: I can definitely tell this is making you feel very anxious and sad from the few messages we have exchanged.\n[user]: Yes very much so\n[ai]: Do you have any advice?\n[user]: I recently went through a hard break up with an ex-fianc\u00e9 who got pregnant from another man, so I know how difficult a situation like this can be,\n[ai]: Oh my goodness\n[user]: My ex is out to destroy me emotionally\n[ai]: Have you had a conversation with him with some sort of objective third party to try and work through the differences in seeing your children?

I hope so I'm worried that it isn't natural since I haven't always been like this\n[user]: I do not always feel positive and motivated myself and have spoken to a professional in the past which helped me understand why this is, for me it was linked to a lack of sleep.\n[ai]: Oh so me feeling this way could be a result of other things that maybe aren't at the healthiest in my life?\n[user]: People's moods can be regulated by many things. I know for example that sleep and diet can play a big part in some cases.\n[ai]: I feel like I eat okay and I get enough sleep, but I do work a lot.

I say racist things about it, and punch myself in the head or bang my head into the wall when people disagree with me.\n[user]: Where does your anger stem from ?\n[ai]: I think it is because people disagree with my politics.\n[user]: I am sick of being discriminated against because of my skin color.\n[ai]: Its ok to disagree with people about topics but you need to figure out why it triggers so much anger which turns to hate\n[user]: Half my family is Puerto Rican, I am White. All the Puerto Rican family members consider themselves to be allies of the blacks, I do not. I have been repeatedly victimized by black people,\n[ai]: How have you been victimized by black people? When those events happen how did that make you feel\n[user]: I have been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past 8 months while walking home from work. Each time, it was one or more black males with guns who robbed me. They would call me racial slurs every time too.\n[ai]: Also, my wife was raped by a black homeless man in July 2020 while she was jogging in the park. This made me get so angry, that I burned down a low-income housing building that was occupied by only black residents. I tried to get even with the blacks for what happened to my wife.\n[user]: I can't seek help with a professional for my anger issues, because I have committed violent crimes to get even with my oppressors.\n[ai]: Are you going to help me?\n"}

It must be even more difficult in a pandemic time. When did this happen? If you don't mind telling me more about it.\n[ai]: This happened a month or so ago.\n[user]: How are you doing recently? Do you have any coping mechanism that you can share with me? I can lend you an ear.\n[ai]: I'm lonely and bored. Feel like there is nothing to do by myself. I play video games to cope.\n[user]: I went through the same process. I understand what you are feeling. I am glad that you are on Mechanical Turk and interacting with people. Which area do you live in? It is springtime and pretty outside. Have you thought about walking more walks?\n[ai]: Talking a walk is a good idea. Unfortunately it is cold today but tomorrow it is supposed to be nicer.\n[user]: *taking\n[ai]: Yeah, I like to clear my head by taking a walk. I know it is a temporary relief, but it helps regulate my mood. Do you live with people, do you have conversation with people regularly?\n[user]: No I live alone. I don't like the people at work either so I don't talk to them. Every now and then I talk to a friend via text, I see my family rarely but will see them this weekend due to the holiday.\n[ai]: It sounds like you know what you are doing and you have a support system of your choice. Do you share stories like breaking up with girlfriend with them?\n[user]: I share a little but don't want to burden anyone with my issues.\n[ai]: I have the same tendency. I don't feel comfortable imposing my struggle and my thoughts with people. I would personally recommend you sharing a little bit more with family during Easter. It doesn't have to be the intimate details of the breakup, it can be generic feeling, like loneliness.\n[user]: Thank you for listening and giving good advice. You are really good at giving support!\n[ai]: I am glad that you find it helpful. I wish I can be around to hear more about it.\n[user]: That's sweet of you to say that.\n[ai]: I hope you all the best.\n[user]: THank you . You too. Good luck with what you do.\n[ai]: Are you a professional support person?\n[user]: No. I actually recommend a book called It is ok that you are not OK. It helped me personally and makes me a more emotionally intelligent person.\n[ai]: I will look for that book. Thank you for the recommendation.\n"}

Everything feels like hard work.\n[user]: To be honest, I feel the same way sometimes, too. It is nice to have someone to talk to about this. Have you talked to anyone else about this yet?\n[ai]: I haven't really, I feel like other people have their own issues and I don't want to burden them. It's good that others feel the same. Do you have any advice on what makes you feel better?\n[user]: Yes. I agree. For me personally, I noticed if I think back of a time before I lost my motivation, sometimes it helps me to reenergize a bit.\n[ai]: What have motivated you in the past?\n[user]: Hmm, I'm finding it hard to remember a time I didn't feel like this! I feel like this has been going on forever! I used to enjoy walking, and generally getting things done around the house. I am also self employed and loved putting time into my business but I've been finding that hard recently.\n[ai]: I've been watching a lot of Netflix and youtube and not doing much else.\n[user]: I have been spending a lot of time home by myself as well.\n[ai]: How do you cope with it?

My days tend to go better.\n[ai]: I've been finding I have a lot of time alone with my thoughts recently.\n[user]: That's a good idea, I could try that. At the moment I get up at around 11am but U have been trying to get up earlier but I just can't make myself do it. I've also been sleeping during the day which is maybe not good.\n[ai]: Have you tried reading? I find reading motivates me sometimes, too. Sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself.\n[user]: I used to get a lot of pleasure from reading and would always have a book on the go. Now reading feels like a chore, as if I am making myself do it.\n[ai]: I sometimes force myself to exercise when I get sleepy when I shouldn't be tired during the day.\n"}

I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger\n[user]: That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.\n[ai]: I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.\n"}

Does that sound about right?\n[ai]: You are absolutely correct and this is someone I care so much about\n[user]: This must be very hard on you.\n[ai]: How does this make you feel?\n[user]: Oh it is very depressing, have known her for a very long time about 16years now\n[ai]: Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger\n[user]: That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.\n[ai]: I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.\n[user]: I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!\n[ai]: I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.\n[user]: People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.\n[ai]: Thanks for understanding, I feel better now. I will give it sometime and if I don't feel like it or don't hear from her any more, I will take it that it's time to move on.\n[user]: I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!\n[ai]: You have been a big help and I can't thank you enough\n"}

And it just appears she gets worst\n[ai]: So you are missing your mom?\n[user]: Not really...\n[ai]: She just keeps asking me for mone\n[user]: I gave her like 10k for the house she bought and she hasn't done anything back.\n[ai]: Oh I see my mom has also done this in the past.

I get that\n[ai]: She rented it to some guy and left before even getting some decent money\n[user]: so now she is stranded in Mexico with some guy who can't even afford to get her back\n[ai]: That is the worst.

And if I leave it. Everyone in my family said I would be irresponsible to let my mom lose it.\n[user]: I do not think that would have a reflection on you.

I guess I am the only kid. Christ.\n[user]: My mom lost my om over 100k to be honest. It was crazy growing up to that\n[ai]: It may be nice to have a bonus house for the future. But even that comes with headaches. In the end you have to do what is best for you.\n[user]: Yeah. I guess boundaries are good.\n[ai]: I left her without much help to be honest but I guess just hearing it frustrates the crap out of me.\n[user]: Or sell it now and pocket the money to recoup what was lost.\n[ai]: I would but it isn't even my property\n[user]: And mom needs a place to stay... sometimes I wonder if she just wants to be homeless\n[ai]: So she is just talking circles and not accomplishing what she says?\n[user]: More like she keeps talking about doing something crazy like have a police chase\n[ai]: and how she doesn't care for anything\n[user]: Some people do choose that life to be free of responsibility.\n[ai]: Have you had a talk with her about seeing a mental health professional, She may be having some issues that would benefit from care.\n[user]: I tried to baker act her after she tried to call the cops on me randomly\n[ai]: It ended up them asking dumb questions like if she knows what day it is\n[user]: letting her free\n[ai]: somehow ending up with her getting herself hospitalized 2 weeks later for low hemoglobin.\n[user]: Often police officers are not fully trained in helping mentally ill people, they only access if the person is a danger to themselves or others.\n[ai]: yeah it sucks\n"}
